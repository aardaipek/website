        "paragraph": "I started my software career by converting designs created on the internet, mostly in Figma, into software using HTML, CSS, and JS. Then, I developed web applications that interacted more with the user using Angular 5 (a JavaScript-based framework). After a few years, I started working on the backend side of software. The fact that there were more interesting topics and development areas here made me stay in this area. I mostly worked on development topics and features to improve the user experience. I discovered that I enjoyed the fact that all the teams I worked with had a specific product roadmap, constantly developing new features and setting new goals due to competition. I have worked in companies of different scales so far, and I have seen both the positive and negative aspects of these scales. This gave me the opportunity to observe the management and sustainability of large teams a lot. It also showed me how to get more efficient and big jobs done with small teams. I am grateful to all these companies for the experiences.",
        "paragraph2": "Although my professional field is software development, I also have areas of interest and curiosity, one of which is investment and finance. Nowadays, I don't think it is enough to specialize in only one field. My interest in this field first started when I read the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad. These two fields, which are similar to each other, are ecosystems that change and develop every day and it is very important to stay up to date. Doing research and reading in these two areas has become one of my favorite hobbies."
