Leveraging advanced technologies such as Dotnet Core (v5-v6) and Angular, I crafted high-performing solutions that helped the product team meet its goals. Throughout the development process, I remained committed to ensuring the platform's reliability and stability by fixing any issues or bugs that arose. This required a keen attention to detail and a deep understanding of the platform's architecture and codebase. In addition to my technical contributions, I actively collaborated with other members of the product team to gather feedback, identify areas for improvement, and continuously iterate on our platform. This included conducting code reviews, participating in design discussions, and working closely with our quality assurance team to ensure that our software met the highest standards of quality.",
